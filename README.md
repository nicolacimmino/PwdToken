# PwdToken

This started as a hardware implementation of a piece of paper with your password and, in some respect, it sill if so use with judgment!

There are (are there?) good reasons sometimes to store a particularly long and complex password in clear form ready to be typed at will. Be careful what you do with this, 
I take no responsibility.

IF you can exclude the Evil Maid scenario this could be something useful which is only one (tiny) step more safe than a piece of paper under your keyboard. You could make an argument that, being this air-gapped, it's safer (Evil Maid scenario excluded) than using an online password manager while retaining the ease of a clear text file cut/paste (!). 

At fist I conceived it mostly a novelty, I found it useful to store the guest WiFi password so, trusted, guests can just plug this in an log in without me having to spell several times the password. However, as time went, I started to think it can have its merits and I wanted to add to it some form of security in the form of tamper detection.
