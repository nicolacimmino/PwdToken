# PwdToken

A hardware implementation of a piece of paper with your password, use with judgment!

There are (are there?) good reasons sometimes to store a particularly long and complex password in clear form ready to be typed at will. Be careful what you do with this, 
I take no responsibility.

IF you can exclude the Evil Maid scenario this could be something useful which is only one (tiny) step more safe than a piece of paper under your keyboard. 

Mostly a novelty, I found it useful to store the guest WiFi password so, trusted, guests can just plug this in an log in.
